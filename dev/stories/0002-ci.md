# User Story: Continuous Integration

As a developer of the FHIR Benchmarks application,
  I need all commits (including those on branches and PRs) to be verified for correctness,
  so that I don't have to remember to run all of those verification tools myself.

## Details

Problems with any of the following should be flagged:

* Compiler warnings and errors.
* Autoformatter errors.
* Linter errors.
* Test failures.

## Questions

* Should I use GitHub Actions?
    * Answer: yes. It's simple, free, and would be good to learn.
* Is there a time/CPU limit on GitHub Actions?
    * If so, might have to cut down on the number of iterations that are run in CI.
    * Answer: It's pay-per-minute (at 0.8 cents per minute) for private repos and free for open source repos. Runners only have 2 vCPUs, 7GB of RAM, and 14 GB of disk space, though.
    * Note: It _might_ be feasible to test each FHIR implementation in a separate job/runner in parallel...
* Can I run Docker Compose in GitHub Actions?
    * If not, I'll have to just test against a mock server that doesn't use it.
    * Notes:
        * This makes it sound like it might be feasible: <https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners>.
