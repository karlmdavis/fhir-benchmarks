# User Story: Improve Management of FHIR Server Dockerfiles

As a benchmark contributor,
  I'd like the various `Dockerfile`s to be better managed
  so that it's easy to understand what version things are pinned to
  and so that it's easy to update that.
I'd also like to either stop using `git submodule`s for those
  or at least to better document how to work with them
  (because I can never remember).


## Planning

This user story is included in the
  [Round 1 Release Plan](../plans/0001-round-1.md).
