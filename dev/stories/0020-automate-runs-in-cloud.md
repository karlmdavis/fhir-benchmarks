# User Story: Automate Benchmark Runs in Cloud

As a benchmark contributor,
  I would like the official benchmark runs (in the cloud) to be fully automated,
  so that I can reliably reproduce their results.


## Details

* Until we support SaaS/cloud-service FHIR server implementations,
    all official benchmark runs should be performed on EC2 metal instances.
