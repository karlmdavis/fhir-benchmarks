# User Story: Timeseries Data: Latency, Operation Count, Request Size

As a benchmark contributor,
  I would like the CI setup for the benchmark application to get some TLC,
  so that its runs are as reliable and fast as is reasonable.


## Planning

This user story is included in the
  [Round 1 Release Plan](../plans/0001-round-1.md).


## Details

* I don't have any specific problems to resolve yet; I just expect that I will, eventually.
