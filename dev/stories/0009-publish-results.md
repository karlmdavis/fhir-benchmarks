# User Story: Publish Results to a Website

As a benchmark consumer,
  I need the benchmark results to be published to a website in a human-friendly way,
  so that I can actually understand and benefit from the data that they provide.


## Details

* Right now, I'm thinking that benchmarks will be formally run and published in "rounds",
    similar to how [TechEmpower's Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/)
    are published.
* I would prefer that the site be static, as that's just easier to host, manage, etc.
