# User Story: Support More `Organization` Operations

As a benchmark consumer,
  I would like the benchmarks to cover more operations on the `Organization` resource,
  so that I can see how reads, searches, etc. perform.


## Planning

This user story is included in the
  [Round 1 Release Plan](../plans/0001-round-1.md).


## Details

* The `Organization` resource isn't particularly compelling,
    but is instead selected here as we already have support for its `POST` operation,
    so adding support for more operations should be less of a lift.
