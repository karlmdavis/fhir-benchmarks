# Round 1 Release Plan

This will be the first official release and also
  the publishing of the first permanent benchmark results.
In general, the goals here are:

1. Provide enough data to help FHIR API server users
     make better-informed decisions than they otherwise could,
     without going so overboard that the release never happens.
2. Provide enough data to help FHIR API server implementors
     understand how their performance stands relative to other implementations
     and also enough information for them to work on improving their performance,
     if they'd like to.
3. Ensure that the results are reasonably stable / repeatable.
4. Make it reasonably simple to add new benchmarks.

It's worth pointing out some goals that are neat & cool & stuff
  but are nevertheless explicitly not in scope for this first release
  (in the interests of ensuring that there _is_ a first release sometime this century):

* Make it easy for implementors to incorporate these benchmarks
    into their build processes.
* Add support for SaaS-only FHIR API server implementations.
* Calculate the cost per request served for each FHIR API server.
