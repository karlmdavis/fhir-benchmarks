The FHIR landscape is expanding and maturing rapidly.
Users now have many great FHIR server implementation options to choose between.
This project aims to help with those choices by
  reporting on the performance of FHIR server implementations.

This "Round 0" of the benchmarks is a preview of the eventual first round
  (which will be "Round 1").
The results captured here are generally transient;
  they'll be discarded/replaced regularly as the benchmarking tool evolves.
In addition, the results will often be from runs that were against
  small datasets, for small numbers of iterations,
  and collected on "small" local development hardware.
In other words: don't take these results too seriously.
