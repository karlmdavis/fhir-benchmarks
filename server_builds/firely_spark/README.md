# Firely's Open Source Spark Server

Originally developed by Firely and now community-maintained,
  [Spark](https://github.com/FirelyTeam/spark)
  is an open source FHIR server.
Spark is written in C# and uses MongoDB as its datastore.

This directory contains a shell script for downloading and launching
  the latest version of Spark,
  [spark_download_and_launch.sh](./spark_download_and_launch.sh).
This script simply grabs the latest Docker Compose file from Spark
  and runs it.
